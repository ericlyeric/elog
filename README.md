There were two points of motivation behind this project,
1. to digitize my notes that I would normally be writing in a notebook (makes them more accessible and consistent)
2. to gain experience building an application using the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) architecture

The project was built with Next.js, and deployed using Netlify
