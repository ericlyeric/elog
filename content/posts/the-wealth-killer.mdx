T﻿he 3 biggest expenses that people have in their lives is
1. Housing
2. Transportation
3. Food

I﻿f you can find a way to save on these it will make a big difference. Small things such as getting a more gas efficient car, doing maintence work on the car yourself; or reducing the insurance on the car can save you a lot of money over the span of a few years. The average operating cost of owning a car is about $10,000 (based on USA data). 

I﻿f you can't get rid of a car, then you could try to be a one car family, live closer to where you need to be at. If you really need to buy a car then buy the car at the right point of the depreciation curve.
