3 Tips from a L7 Principal Software Engineer at Amazon.

### 1. Get Your Money Right
You need to invest, time in the market is so much better than timing the market. Buy some index funds, put it in some cryptocurrency, invest it in yourself to grow a side hustle.

### 2. Impact > Output
Prefer impact over output, most of the time if you're not around someone else will pick up the slack. Taking more critical tickets and resolving more bugs doesn't make you stand out. A better way to stand out is to make a larger impact relative to their level (eg. a refactor that prevents defects, finding the root cause to a class of tickets so they stop popping up and paging your team). 

### 3. Clearly Thinking About Staying / Leaving
Leaving teams is a difficult things to do. If you're only taking orders from your manager and you don't have room to make an impact you need to leave. If your team is awesome don't go chasing some marginal improvement. A few tips on what to look for:
1. Is your manager good?
2. Is the pay good?
3. Promises that things will change, don't be swayed by words, only be deeds
4. Lack of growth

Golden ages are not recognized in the moment, only when you look back.
