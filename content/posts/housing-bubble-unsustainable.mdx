summary: Evaluation of the trends in income and housing prices to identify how
  overvalued housing prices are
---
Home price to income ratio is even higher today than the lead up to the 2007 housing bubble. The two trends that determine housing prices are demographics and income. Most housing consumers are between 25-64 years old (this bracket pulls the average up, the brackets outside pull the average down.

H﻿ousing is regional however the national average will follow the trends in overall demographics and overall income. Currently the 25-64 year old population (in USA) is declining, l﻿ess likely to have an economic expansion.

**D﻿isposable income**: includes wages, salaries, interest, rental income, dividends, and more, it subtracts out tax payments

**Disposable income per capita**: how much income each person is generating after taxes

C﻿urrently (statistics for USA), disposable income per capita is ~$56k and the average home price for a new home is ~$547k, home price to income ratio is ~9.7 times. The home price to income ratio is cyclical it usually swings from overvalued to undervalued; the cycles can last 3-5 years or longer. From history usually after the home price to income ratio reaches 9 times, the ratio goes down to about 7.5 times, since 1960's the ratio is about 8.1 times.

F﻿or example if we take the the average disposable income $56k and apply the 8.1 times home price to income ratio we would get $453k for a new home price. If we apply 7.5 times home price to income ratio we would get $420k. If we adjust for the income and below average home price to income ratio we would have $58k and 7.5 times, giving us $436k.

I﻿ncome is a nominal concept meaning it is not adjusted for inflation; income almost never goes down, although it can slow down. Since 2019, income is up 13% whereas home prices are up 45%, home prices rose much quicker than income because mortgage rates were at it's lowest (~2.5%), the federal reserves were pumping money into the economy, and the supply of newly constructed homes was limited. Today, the mortgage rate is the highest in over a decade (~6.6%), the federal reserves are leveling off the money they're pumping in, and the newly constructed homes supply is at its highest since 2008. 

I﻿t is fair to assume that the home price to income ratio will fall back down to the average (8.1 times) it could go lower (7.5 times). Which could to equate to mortgage rates falling about ~15% nationally, note depending on the region it will vary; highly speculative regions will take a bigger hit.
