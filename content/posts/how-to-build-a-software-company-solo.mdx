summary: Steps to building a software company solo
---
## Reasons to start a software company
- very high margins
- more control and security, you are not dependent on a platform, have more freedom in customer interactions
- ﻿ opportunities for recurring revenue

## Reasons to not start a software company
- more work upfront to start
- can be more costly to start if you don't have the necessary skills (building software)

## Step 1: Choosing an idea
- if it's your first venture, don't make it something super novel (something that has never been done before) you're making it harder for yourself
- pick something that users want and need (not necessarily something you like or enjoy)
- look at existing software companies that already have a large user base, and look at their core product, and do something slightly different
-﻿ a good place to look at [AppSumo](https://appsumo.com/) to see what software services are being offered

## Step 2: Validate your idea
- set-up a landing page, and allow the landing page to take credit card information but don't actually charge the card

## Step 3: Tech Stack
- choose what you already know
- worry about can this work at all, not can this scale to a million users
- worry about scalability when you have a user base that warrants a codebase rewrite or reorg
- build for a user, then scale afterwards and so on

## Step 4: Pricing
- look at competitors and see what they are charging, you can either charge a bit less or charge the same

## Step 5: Getting Customers
- figure out where similar softwares are getting their customers and go to the same place
- figure out where your target customers hang out and go there
