## What are Microservices?
Microservices are small, autonomous services that work together. They are small and focused on doing one thing well. The service boundaries are focused on business boundaries, making it obvious where code lives for a given piece of functionality. 

The smaller the service, the more you maximize the benefits and downsides of the microservice architecture. As you get smaller the benefits around interdependence increase. 

All communication between the services themselves are via network calls, to enforce separation between the services and avoid tight coupling. These services should be independent and deployed by themselves without any dependancies. The golden rule: Can you make a change to a service and deploy it by itself without changing anything else? In order to decouple well you need to model your services right adn get the API's right.

## Key Benefits
- **Technology Heterogeneity** - with a system composed of muiltiple collaborating services we can decide to use different technologies inside each one. We are also about to adopt technology more quickly, there's an inherent larger risk with a monolithic application to try new technologies.
- **Resilience** - service boundaries are the obvious bulkheads, if one component of a system fails the failure shouldn't cascade and the rest of the system should carry on working. In a monolithic services, if the service fails, everything stops working.
- **Scaling** - large monolithic services scale everything out together. With smaller independent pieces we can scale those services that needs scaling.
- **Ease of Deployment** - a change in a monolithic application requres the whole application to be deployed in order to release the change; this usually results in bigger deltas between releases. With microservices we can change a single service and deploy it independently from the rest of the system.
- **Organizational Alignment** - smaller teams working on smaller codebases tend to be more productive. Microservices help minimize the number of people working on any one codebase.
- **Composability** - with microservices we allow for our functionality to be consumed in different ways for different purposes (Web, native application, mobile web, tablet app, wearable device etc).
- **Optimizing for Replaceability** - with small individual services its cost to replace them with a better implementation is easier to manage. A lot of the times legacy systems are large and risky to replace.

## What about Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)?
Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a design approach where multiple services collaborate to provide some end set of capabilities. It is an approach aimed to promote the reuseability of software. Microservices is an approach to SOA, much alike XP or Scrum are for Agile software development.

## Other Decompositional Techniques
- **Shared Libraries** - a very standard decompositional technique built into any language is breaking down a codebase into multiple libraries. Libraries give you a way to share functionality between teams and services. The drawback is you lose technology heterogeneity as typically libraries has to be in the same langauge, and you cannot deploy a new library without redeploying the entire system that is linked to that library. Common tasks that aren't specific to your business domain and that is to be reused across the organization is a good candidate for a shared library.
- **Modules** - some languages provide their own modular decomposition techniques that go beyond simple libraries; they allow some lifecycle management of modules such that they can be deployed into a running process without needing to take the whole process down.

## Summary
Microservices is not a silver bullet, they have all associated complexities of distrubuted systems, more work has to go into handling deployments, testing, and monitoring.
