summary: Core concepts on web scalability

**scalability (in software)** : is the ability to adjust the capacity of the system to cost-efficiently fulfill the demands. Scalability usually means an ability to handle more users, clients, data, transactions, or requests without affecting the user experience. It is important to remember that scalability should allow us to scale down as much as scale up and that scaling should be relatively cheap and quick to do.

### I﻿mportant metrics in scalability:

1. handling more data
2. handling higher concurrency levels (measures how many clients your system can serve at the same time)
3. handling higher interaction rates (meaures how often your clients exchange information with your servers)

S﻿caling down is usually less important than scaling up. Scalability is related to performance but its not the same. Performance measures how long it takes to process a request or certain task, whereas scalability measures how much we can grow (or shrink).

## Single Server Configuration
T﻿he simplest configuration possible and how many small projects are started, an entire application runs on one single machine. Usually the Doman Name System (DNS) server is used as a paid service provided by the hosting company and is not running on your own server. Users connect to the DNS to obtain the IP of your server where the website is hosted. Once the IP is obtained they send Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests directly to your web server. 

F﻿or sites with low traffic a single-server configuration may be enough to handle requests made by clients. Reasons why this configuration is not going to go far scalability-wise:
- each new user creates additional load on the servers, and serving each user consumes more resources
- as more data is added, database queries will slow down
- adding more functionality will require users to make more interactions requiring more resources

**virtual private server** - a term used by hosting providers to describe a virtual machine for rent. When you purchase a VPS instance, it is hosted together with other VPS instances on a shared host machine. VPS behave like a regular server, it is cheaper than a dedicated server as multiple instances can exist at the same time on the same physical machine. VPS is a good starting point as it is cheap and can usually be upgraded instantly.

**shared hosting** - is the cheapest hosting solution, wher you purchase a user account without admin privileges. Your account is installed on a server together with many other customers' accounts. It is a good starting point for the smallest websites or landing pages but it is too limiting so its not a recommended option.
