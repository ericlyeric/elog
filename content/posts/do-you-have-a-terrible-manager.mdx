summary: Good managers keep their best people and their best people are more productive
---
You're likely to have at least 20 managers throughout your career. Good managers keep their best people and their best people are more productive. A good question to ask is are the best engineers on your team leaving or staying? If you are the best engineer you are the arbiter and you decide if the manager is good or not, you should leave if you think the manager is not good, and stay if you think the manager is good. 

## Things to verify (3 critical steps)

1. How long has the team existed, if its a new team trying to staff up, then check the managers track record (low productivity managers tend not to stick around).
2. If your team is not new then how long has the manager been on the team. Don't join a team with a manager that hops around too much.
3. What is the attrition rate (*churn rate: rate at which people leave*) of the people already on the team, you don't want to join a sinking ship.
