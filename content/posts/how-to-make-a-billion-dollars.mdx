You don't make a billion dollars to become a billionaire you own stuff that's worth a billion dollars. 

## How something that is worth a billion dollars is actually made
You have something that is making between $80M-$100M ebitda (profit). Usually companies of this size trade at 15X on the stock market (then theoretically $70M ebitda will bring you to a billion, assuming you own the company). It is better to try to shoot past $1B, it helps you think in bigger increments. You need to consider these factors about the opportunity:
- not limited by your time
- could serve a very big marketplace
- had very high gross margins
- think on a very long time horizon

The reason why you can't sell something as much as someone else is because you don't know how to create as much value.
