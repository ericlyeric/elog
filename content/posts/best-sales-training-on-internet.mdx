## A few beliefs about selling ...
1. People want to believe you. They want to buy. You must help their logical brain to justify the decision.
2. Selling happens before you ask, closing begins after.
3. It's easier to handle obstacles than objections (before you ask rather than after).
4. That being said, expect and plan for NO. Iti s not failure, it is expected. Stop being surprised!
5. If you didn't get a gasp from the price tag, you didn't go high enough.
6. Selling properly is the first step to becoming a coach. Your first impression, and the expectations you set dictate the relationship.
7. Selling is helping prospects make decisions to help themselves
8. Keep the prospect, not the sale, as the priority. It's not about you
9. Seek to understand, not argue
10. Maintain childlike curiosity at all times
11. Closing is a dance, not a fight.
12. Selling is a transference of belief over a bridge of trust. Therefore, you must have the belief, in order to transfer it
13. You can only build trust if you genuinely want to help. And humans are exceptionally good at sniffing out intention
14. Belief & trust are continuums, not binaries. Treat them accordingly
15. Closers ask hard questions - because they genuinely care
16. The person who cares the most about the prospect wins the deal
17. Record all your sales. Always
18. Power is the ability to direct or influence people. If you want to be powerful you must learn this skill

Y﻿ou're only one decision away from changin your life forever.

B﻿ut instead of changing our lives, we blame (think give power to) sources outside of our control. This is why so many people are weak and powerless.

## Sales Ethics
- helping someone make a decision to help themselves does NOT mean buying from you
- it means helping them and their goals at the center of the decision
- you should be HAPPY if someone makes a decision for themselves INDEPENDENT of whether they choose to work with you or not

**obstacle**: a thing that blocks one's way or prevents or hinders process (when you disagree with something the prospect says)

**objections**: an expression or feeling of disapproval or opposition; a reason for disagreeing (when they disagree with something you said)

T﻿he person must really want the goal or believe:
1. The product will get them to their goal the way they want to go
2. You, and others will support them
3. It will work for them, not just everyone else
