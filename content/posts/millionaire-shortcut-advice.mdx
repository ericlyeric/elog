summary: Asking millionaires for the shortcut to $100,000
---
- ask yourself who do you need, not how do I do this, you don't need to build an audience to sell to, figure out who already has an audience so you can execute right now
- building a successful business is about the people, people buy the products, design, build the products, implement the strategies, everything starts and ends with people

1. Thinking long term 
- build the fundemental business skills
- you don't need to reinvent the wheel, a lot of stupid people make a lot of money, just follow what they're doing
- find a product that is already valuable, focusing only on proof of concept
- learn processes
2. Focus on relationships (peer groups, partnerships, employees, personal, romantic)
- if you want to be a millionaire, hang out with millionaires
- hang out with people who you aspire to be like so you can learn from them
- be the person that other people want to network with, which is increase your own internal value
3. Enjoy the journey
- you shouldn't be focusing on the exit or the end result, the journey is it
- focus on the simple boring, generic, fundemental stuff
