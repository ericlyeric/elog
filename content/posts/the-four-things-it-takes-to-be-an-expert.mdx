summary: Expertise is recognition, and recognition comes from highly structured
  information stored in long term memory

They say it takes about 10,000 hours to become an expert, but deliberate practice is the key, not just putting in the time. The quality of the hours spent on practicing the skill is important, you have to be practicing in the uncomfortable zone attempting things you can't do quite yet.

At its core, expertise is recognition and recognition comes from an incredible amount of highly structured information stored in long-term memory. To build that environment it requires these four things:

1. **Repeated attempts with feedback** - a lot of experts with specific knowledge can't get predicitions correct because they lack repeated experience with feedback.
2. **Valid environment** - low validity environments contain a lot of randomness, so the feedback doesn't reflect quality of the decision making. Aside: humans like to predict the outcome to beat the average, but when there is no pattern this is a terrible strategy.
3. **Timely feedback** - with timely feedback its easy to learn the regularities of their environment.
4. **Don't get too comfortable** - If you want to improve you need to be in challenging situations. In order to learn you have to work in the edge of your ability; pushing beyond your comfort zone.
