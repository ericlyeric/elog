summary: JWT is used for authorization not authentication
---
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between two parties as a JSON object. The information is digitally signed via a secret (HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key (RSA or ECDSA). 

JWT is used for authorization not authentication.

**Authorization**: is the security process that determines a user or service's level of access.

**Authentication**: is the process that verifies that someone or something is who they say they are.

A JWT token is comprised of three parts, each part is separated with a period:
1. **Header**: the algorithm and token type
2. **Payload**: the data
3. **Verify Signature**: the verification signature

JWT tokens can be shared among the clients so the user will not need to re-login. When you're using sessions, the session is stored in the server and you'll need to re-login when you hit another service.
