## A few steps...
### Step 1: Find an open-source project to contribute to or start your own project
- [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore/)
- [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
- [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
- [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/)
- [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/)
- [Contributor-ninja](https://contributor.ninja/)
- [First Contributions](https://firstcontributions.github.io/)\
- [SourceSort](https://web.archive.org/web/20201111233803/https://www.sourcesort.com/)
- look into libraries and frameworks that you're familar with and scan through their current issues

### Step 2: Scan the project rules
Every project has different rules, check the following documentation
- `README`
- `LICENSE`
- `CONTRIBUTING`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`

### Step 3: Find what you'll be working on
- Issues are used for startin conversation or discuss
- Pull requests are for starting work on a solution

### Step 4: Fork the project
Go to the repository and fork the project, make yourself the owner.

### Step 5: Create a branch with your changes
Make your changes in a new branch.

### Step 6: Open a Pull Request
Create your PR, if your PR resolves any issue number mention it in the comment.

### Step 7: Wait for a review
Wait for someone to review your PR, and/or approval. From here a few things can happen
- You don't get a response, the project isn't active
- Someone requests changes to your contribution
- Your contribution doesn't get accepted
- Your contributiton gets accepted
