API Gateway (Edge Microservice) - an API management tool that sits between a client and a collection of backend services. It acts as a reverse proxy to accept all API calls, aggregate the various services required to fulfill them , and return the appropriate result.

## How do you start using an API Gateway?
1. Identify your external API
2. Bring in the gateway microservice (calling on existing microservices and passing on the response) aka API composition

## Optional steps to API Gateway
1. Add monitoring
2. Handle authentication 

## Cons
- response times will be slower
- how many API Gateways do you need (if you only have one what if it goes down?)
- BFF pattern (backend for frontend) might need different API Gateways depending on the device that is calling it
