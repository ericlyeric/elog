### Basic concepts to understand about any business
- how the business works
- how the business profits
- how to raise capital to start a company
- how to monetize your business investment

### W﻿hy raise debt? 
- by borrowing money you keep more of the stock to yourself (better off if the business is successful)

### B﻿alance sheet tells you about: 
- assets
- liabilities
- net worth of a company

**F﻿ixed asset**: an investment in physical property used to generate income

### I﻿ncome statement tells you about:

- revenues
- expenses
- net profits

I﻿ncome / Revenue = profit margin

### W﻿hy does the equity investor earn more than the lender?
- they take on higher risk
- debt has a priority return over equity
- debt is inherently safer than equity
- equity has a residual claim

W﻿hen investing your own money think about the probability of the permanent loss of capital

P﻿aying dividends to yourself will give you more cash in your pocket, but slower growth and less profit for the business

S﻿elling the entire company will give you more cash in your pocket, but you give up control and future profits 
- selling a piece of the business is an alternative
- find a private investor and share the profits
- another alternative is going public

### I﻿nitial Public Offering (IPO)
- does not make someone rich, it takes a piece of the business and sells it to the general public and it gets listed on the exchange
- when you're selling to the public you need to reveal a lot of information to attract investors to want to participate
- yields the optimally high price for the company
- lets you retain part or most of the company
- requires a board of directors which looks after public interest, reduced flexibilty
- benefits of selling to the public, market liquidity, makes existing the business easier

T﻿he most valuable asset in investing is time
