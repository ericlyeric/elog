## What is happening and what you need to do
You need to get a cash flowing business and save up the money. If you have a job, budget and save the money, but during a recession people get laid off. Don't spend money on things you don't need, save up as much money as you can. After every single recession a bull market follows (historically); on average recessions last from 8-48 months. By the time a recession is announced we would've already been in the recession for 6 months.

## What businesses to start
The key traits of the business you would want is highly scalable, online, essential to other businesses to survive (make them money). Some options:
- a service based business around 1 skill
- freelancing job that makes peoples lives easier or makes more money for the business

It's easier to start a business during a recession because
- it's easier to hire talent
- suppliers are more negotiable
- cheaper to borrow money (usually by the end of it)
- bad businesses go out of business
- less competition

### Some businesses to start
- dropshipping/ecommerce
- Amazon FBA
- affiliate marketing
- start an agency (branding and design, email marketing, Google ads, Facebook ads, promotional agency, Twitter/YouTube growth, credit repair, home detailing/office cleaning), all agencies work by having a guy running the business (owner), and the people that get hired to do the work, and you have your clients. Start an agency behind anything that somebody needs, anything that can be valuable to somebody that you could sell to them but that you could also outsource; as long as you can create value around it you can sell it to someone.

- graphic designer
- thumbnail for content creators
- video editing agency (repurpose peoples content, post on TikTok)

- deal closer / network manager (for influencers)
- YouTube, start a personal brand, take popular and interesting studies and summarize them into 10 minute YouTube videos, put animations on it so they're really easy to understand, and an industry that you really like and add your own sauce to it
- online coach / tutor / training
- buying and selling domains
- website remodelling (send a loom video to them)
