U﻿sing interest free credit card, so thats why it's 30 days; you can use money interest free, as long as you pay it off in 30 days.

T﻿he following formula for Client Financed Acquisition CFA:

**3﻿0 days cash > 2(AC + COGS)**

*W﻿here*
- A﻿C = Acquiring Customer
- C﻿OGS = Cost of Good Sold (fulfillment + sell)

e﻿g. if AC = $100, COGS = $100

- 3﻿0 days cash > 2 * (AC + COGS)
- 3﻿0 days cash > $400

P﻿ut the money on the card to fulfill the customer, a﻿nd acquire, and your net minus the paying off the debt to acquire will give you enough to acquire another customer, assuming at least 2x, if > 2 * (AC + COGS) its even better. Just rinse and repeat to acquire more customers.

I﻿f you grow your companies this way you can grow your companies without capital constraint. Use the customers money to grow your own business.
