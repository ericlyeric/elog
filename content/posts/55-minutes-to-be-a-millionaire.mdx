*I﻿t's not about how hard you row, it's about what boat you're in*

## Observations
- everyone wants you to do well, just not better than them
- accept that no one actually wants you to be rich, but you
- money only solves money problems, then you are left with problems money can't solve
- you don't arrive you just enter a new club as the smallest member
- passive income is overrated, we seek freedom, but what we really want are options of engaging activites

*﻿Time allocation is the only thing that matters. If you master time, you master material success.*

W﻿hat appears to be speed is not from 'lots of activity' it is making the right strategic decisions and making fewer mistakes. People who make the most money stick with the same thing for a very long period of time.

## Money = Denomination of time
- every transaction we make is for some percentage of our lives
- our wealth is a measure of how little of our lives we must trade for the things we desire
- money is an IOU from society for future goods and services, which is translated as other people's time
- the key multiplier in time is *leverage*

## Billionaire advice
- it's harder to build a small business than a big business because level 10 talent is only attracted to big opportunities
- big goals and small goals are both hard to achieve, so you might as well make them big, so it's worth pushing through the inevitable hard times

## 4 Frameworks for Understanding Leverage & Scale
1. Scale the entrepreneur
2. Scale the market
3. Scale the delieverable
4. Scale the business

E﻿ntrepreneur x Market x Delieverable x Business Accumen = Fortune

## 1. Scaling the Entrepreneur
Y﻿ou are not making as much as you want because you're not as good as you think you are. If someone in your market is making more than you, it's because they are better than you at the game. Admit to your weaknesses and get better. Every business is bottlenecked by the entrepreneur in 3 ways
1. skill deficiency
2. trait deficiency
3. belief deficiency

## 2. Scaling the Market
P﻿ick the right market, how to pick the right market, select the avatar you can provide the most value to. The four attributes to consider when pursuing an opportunity:
1. Pain
2. Purchasing power
3. Easy to target
4. Growth

S﻿caling your market
1. Go up market
2. Go down market
3. Go to adjacent market
4. Go broader
5. Go deeper in your existing market

## 3. Scale the Deliverable
T﻿he pyramid of leverage (first is highest, last is lowest) 
- code/content (0 permission required)
- capital (permission required)
- collaboration/labour (permission required)

E﻿verything is for sale, the only things you can ever sell:
- products
- services
- access
- media
- risk
- money

## 4. Scale the Business
T﻿he entrepreneurial journey
- $0-$1M, one product, one avatar, one channel, problem: no idea what you're doing, objective: consistently sell something people actually want
- $1M-$10M, increase the lifetime gross profit per customer, problem: not making enough profit per customer to scale, objective: add higher leverage delieverables
- $10M-$50M, consistency of delievery, professionalization of business, problem: inconsistent delivery, poor tracking, CRM issues, finances are a mess, solution: hire high level experience who have done this before
- $50M-$100M+, must grow revenue streams, conglomeration, a business of businesses, problem: innovation dies, product no longer new and fresh, solution: new talent, incentivized to drive growth and innovate
