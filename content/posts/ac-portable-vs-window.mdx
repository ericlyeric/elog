## What does an air conditioner do?

An air conditioner is a system for controlling humidity, ventilation, and temperature; typically to maintain a cool atmosphere in warm conditions

## How does an air conditioner work?

They move heat in air from one place to another, the cold air is normal air with it's heat energy removed through a cooling process. The removed heat is released into the outside air. 

An efficient air conditioner can be simplied as such

1. a hot side
2. a compressor
3. a cold side

When trying to cool a room, we want the hot side, outside, and the cold side, inside. Then we can move the heat energy from inside to outside.

## Window AC

The bulk of the unit is outside, the hot side is outside, and the cold side is inside. The unit pulls in hot air from inside the room, cools it, blows the hot air outside, and blows the cold air back inside.

## Portable AC

The whole unit is inside, so the hot side and the cold side is inside. The unit pulls in hot air from inside the room, cools it, and blows the cold air and the hot air outside through the hose. This also greats a low pressure environment where the outside air pressure is greater than the inside, which means the air outside (which is hot) is going to make its way inside to achieve equilibrium.

## Summary

Window AC's expell the hot air out, and recirculate the air that was cooled back inside. Whereas the Portable AC's expell the hot air, cold air and the inside air out creating a low pressure environment (which draws the outside hot air inside).

If you must get a Portable AC, then get a 2 hose system (they are rare).
