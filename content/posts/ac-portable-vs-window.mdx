## What does an air conditioner do?

An air conditioner is a system for controlling humidity, ventilation, and temperature; typically to maintain a cool atmosphere in warm conditions.

## How does an air conditioner work?

An efficient air conditioner can be simplied as such

1. a hot side (ideally outside)
2. a compressor
3. a cold side (ideally inside)

When trying to cool a room, we want the hot side to be outside, and the cold side to be inside the room. 

## Window AC

The bulk of the AC unit is outside, the hot side is outside, and the cold side is inside the room. The AC unit pulls in hot air from inside the room and outside; cools it, and then blows the cooled air back into the room. All the hot air that is flowing through the AC unit is expelled outside.

## Portable AC

The whole AC unit is inside, so the hot side and the cold side are both inside the room. The AC unit pulls in hot air from inside the room, cools it, however the cooled air and hot air are mixed and blown outside to through the hose. Some of the mixed air (cooled air and hot air) are blown back into the room. Since we are blowing air out but not taking air in, this creates a low pressure environment where the outside air pressure is greater than the inside, which means the air outside (which is hot) is going to make its way inside the room to equal out the air pressure.

## Summary

Window AC's expell the hot air out, and blow the cooled air inside the room. Whereas the Portable AC's expell the hot air and cooled air outside; and operate in a low pressure environment (drawing in hot air from outside, into the room).

If you must get a Portable AC, then get a 2 hose system (they are rare, and quite expensive).
