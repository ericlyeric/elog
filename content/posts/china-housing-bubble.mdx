summary: Explanation on why China is in a housing bubble
---
T﻿he housing sector and construction sector are extremely important for an economy and is a major engine of economic growth; it is very boom or bust. Typically you need to cleanse the system after a large boom for new productive growth on the other end. China has not cleansed its system after the boom; China has a huge economic reliance on building buildings. 

W﻿hen a country runs into real estate excess, a bust follows a boom. China's housing market is more than 8 times the size of the China stock and bond market. 

T﻿he working age population (15-64) is declining for China. Japan had an economic model based on real estate in the 1980's and it ended in the 1990's when population growth went negative. Spain also had an economic model based on real estate and it ended in 2010 when the population growth went negative. China has been in a negative population growth since 2015, you can't add more housing units with less people and keep the home prices going up; more supply, less demand.

W﻿ithout real estate 1/3 of China's economy disappears. Real estate is the sector of growth for the entire world, but China inflated its housing bubble 3 times since 2010. If China continues to build more housing units without the demand, then they will only be able to stimulate the their economy by printing more money, devaluing their currency.
