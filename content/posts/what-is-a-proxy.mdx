Proxy - the authority to represent someone else (common in voting process). In computer networking its when a device is acting on behalf of another device.

The direction of exchange is key, who is sending the data and who is receiving the data? After that is established; a proxy and a reverse proxy is the same concept but in different directions.

## (Forward) Proxy

Proxy requests going out (typically clients). The receiver doesn't know where the where the client is making the request from; the receiver knows what the request is but not where it is coming from. Common use case is the ISP acting as a proxy when you're visiting a website on the web. Another common use case is at the workplace where they use a corporate proxy to block certain websites. 

### Pros

1. Selectively send/block requests
2. Log or monitor requests
3. Caching responses

## Reverse Proxy

Proxies requests coming in (typically servers). The client talks to one proxy, and the proxy decides which server it needs to talk to complete the request. 

### Pros

1. Security (eg. DDoS attack prevention, firewall, block bots)
2. Caching
3. Load balancing (most common use case)
