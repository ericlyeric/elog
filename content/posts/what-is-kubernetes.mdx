Kubernetes is an orchestration tool for running managing container based workloads, developed by Google. It helps to manage containerized applications in different environments.

The trend from monolith to microservices resulted in an increased usage of containers, the demand for a proper way of managing hundreds of containers was why container orchestration tools (Kubernetes) was created.

Orchestration tools offer 
- high availability (no downtime)
- scalability
- disaster recovery (backup and restore)

Monoliths are a common way to build applications into a single deployable artifact. Deployments can take a long time as everything needs to roll out together, if different parts of the monolith are managed by different teams it adds additional complexity to the deployment. 

Microservices are structuring the application as a collection of services that are 
- loosely coupled
- highly maintainable and testable
- independently deployable 
- organized around business capabilities
- owned by a small team

This allows for rapid, frequent delivery at large for complex applications.

Containerizing microservices will package up all dependancies and configuration and ensure the services will run the same way no matter where they're ran.

Kubernetes doesn't suite monoliths that well, the first step into using Kubernetes is to start using containers. 

Kubernetes manages containers on virtual machines (nodes). The nodes and the containers they run are grouped together as a cluster and each container has endpoints, DNS, storage, and scalability.
