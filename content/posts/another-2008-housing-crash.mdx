A loan officer gives you a loan to buy a house, two types of people, a first type buyer, or a buyer who already owns a home. An example of how interest rates affect a $500k house:
- @3% ~$2,366/mo.
- @6% ~$3,199/mo.
- @9% ~$4,139/mo. 

Interest rates will go up because too much money has been printed, there's 'fake' success. House affordability is destroyed when the interest rates are high, from our example someone who could afford a $500k house can now only afford a ~$300k house (that's 40% drop in affodability).

When active listing volume goes down, the prices go up because there's less inventory. If active listing volume goes up, and builders have a bunch of places that are not occupied, and the amount of mortgage applications go lower; the price of a house will need to decrease if you want to sell it. Active listing is an important metric to track, it tells a story.

Less disposable income leads to less spending, lower business profits, layoffs, foreclosures, crime/drugs/addiction, protest/riots. 

Real estate should be around 3x or 4x your income. In 2008 it was 8x your income, right now its 8.5x your income; in order for this to go down you either need to increase your income (which is difficult if there's layoffs), or the price of homes need to come down. 

American dream is not home ownership; equity in businesses, entrepreneurship, side hustles, being apart of a start up; then when you make the money you can buy the house if you want to. Right now today its more expensive to buy than to rent. 

Start a side business to make extra cash, save money (cash) things will be discounted in the next 6-18 months. Do your own research, research your own industries or industries that you want to get into, see what happened in the past.
