summary: Two advantages agility and contrarian knowledge
---
## Two advantages:
1. **Agility**: ability to pivot ability to be lean
2. **Contrarian Knowledge**: believes something is below its intrinsic value and realizing the opportunity

## Agility
You can get into industries that people with long standing careers can't. For instance currently some people with brick and mortar businesses are dealing with supply chain issues causing decreased revenues. An online cash-flow based business with low start up cost, and low overhead cost is ideal. You can reduce expenses by moving to a geographically economical place. Do not start difficult/impractical business.

## Contrarian View
You need to understand the mis-information that is being presented on the news and the internet. Don't follow the sheep, tap into online resources and social media platforms to see what reputable people with a good track record and suggesting; then make your own decisions from there. To find the right resources you what to look for two things:
1. People that question their beliefs and play devils advocate on themselves
2. People that understand the bigger picture (why something happened, and what is going on in the world)
