## What is a stock?
A piece of a company, you own a piece of the company through your share ownership, units of stocks are called 'shares'
- corporations sell stock to raise funds for their business
- you can own one share, multiple shares, or fractions of shares

## Types of stocks
**Common stock**
- ownership in company and right to vote, one vote per share
- dividends
- over long run yields higher returns than most other investments but comes at high risk\

**Preferred stock**
- carry characteristics of both bonds and stocks
- no voting rights
- get paid out first in case of bankruptcy
- harder to lose or gain value

**ETFs, mutual funds**
- both track and invest in collections of stocks and assets
- mutual funds are more complex in structure and are actively managed (higher fees)
- ETFs are passively managed (lower fees)
- ETFs actively traded throughout trading day, while mutual funds trades close at end of trading day when the final price is calculated

## Categorizing stocks
**Size** - market cap (market capitalization) total value of all company shares
- small: $300 million - $2 billion
- medium: $2 billion - $10 billion
- large: $10 billion+

**Sectors**
- Technology
- Energy
- Automotive
- etc.

**Location**

**Growth vs. Value**
- growth stocks: can possibly outperform market due to future potential (more risky)
- value stocks: currently trading at a discount

## Risk Tolerance
Cash -> Bonds -> Index funds -> Individual stocks -> Real estate -> Cryptocurrencies -> Trading options

## Types of Trades
**Market Order**: buy or sell immediately
- fastest and most basic type of trade
- guarantees execution of order, but does not guarantee execution price
- buy or sell near or at current execution price

**Limit Order**: buy or sell at specific price
- order executes if the stock hits that price
- buy limit order only executed at limit price or lower
- sell limit order only executed at limit price or higher

**Stop Order**: buy or sell when the price moves past a specified price
- when stop price reached, stop order becomes limit/market order
- buy stop order: entered at stop price above current market price, used to limit losses or to protect profits on stock that they have sold short
- sell stop order: entered at price below current market price, used to limit losses or protect profits on stocks they own

## How to Research Stocks
- **Price**: cost to purchase one share of company stock
- **52 week low and high**: max and min price of stock within 1 year trading period
- **Trading volume**: quantity of shares trade during a given period
- **Market capitalization**: total market value
- **Beta**: stocks volatility in relation to the overall market
- **P/E ratio**: price per share / annual earnings per share. Allows you to compare companies based on price vs how much moeny the business is earning. Lower PE ratio is better.
- **PEG ratio**: Price to earnings to growth ratio, (P/E)/(EPS growth over given time period), values stock while factoring in expected earnings growth. Considered to be an indicator of stocks true value, lower is 'better'.
  - Under 1 = 'undervalued'
  - Over 1 = 'overvalued'
- **Dividend yield**: how much a company pays out in dividends each year compared to its stock price. Annual dividends per share / current share price. High dividend yield could mean business is not reinvesting its cash properly or business's share price is declining
- **Price/Book ratio: stock price / book value per share. Tell us market valuation of a company (usually higher) versus its 'book' value. Book value is found from net assets of a company (assets - debt = book value). Usually market value is higher than book value.
  - Under 1 is 'undervalued' (although nowadays its more like 3)
  - Over 1 is 'overvalued' (although nowadays its more like 3)
- **Profit margin**: profit per dollar of revenue, expressed as a percentage, used to access companies financial health, varies by industry and sector
- ** ROE (Return on Equity)**: return on assets, measures financial performance of a company - more specifically how efficiently a company generates profits. Net income / shareholders equity.
  - 15% and up is considered 'good' but depends on industry and sector
- **Current ratio**: current assets / current liabilities. Measures short term liquidity of a company.

## Timing the Market
When trying to predict the stock market (gains, crashes) and using those predictions to influence your buying and selling patterns. Historically it has been better to buy after a crash than to try and time a market high. Holding longer makes investing 'safer'. Don't time the market, instead spend more time in the market.

## Dollar Cost Averaging
Gradually invest into a company over time instead of all at once. Controls average price, protects against volatile price movements.

## Tax Loss Harvesting
Sell shares at a loss to offest a capital gains tax liability (usually at the end of the year). Sell stocks that you lost moeny on (creates a loss) to offset the gains in that year.

## What would Warren Buffet do?
- a company with great leadership
- stocks with a margin of safety
- companies that will last in the long term (if you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years then don't buy it)
- for 95% of people an index fund like the S&P 500 is the best for building long term wealth
- buy what you know about after doing research
- invest with facts, not emotions
- when you see a great opportunity, take it

## Value vs Momentum Investing
- value investing - lower PE ratios, fundemental analysis
- momentum investment approach - future potential of a company

## How much should you invest?
- never invest more than what you can afford to lose, focus on raising your income first the more money you amke the more you can invest
- consider investing in things with higher ROI (self improvement, building a business, education, courses, networking)
- prioritize index funds
- do your own research before investing in any stock
- fundemental analysis vs. technical analysis
- consider important metrics like P/E ratio, PEG ratio, P/B ratio etc.
