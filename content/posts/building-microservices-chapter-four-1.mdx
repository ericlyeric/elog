summary: Focus on seams first to establish boundaries before splitting a monolith
---
**﻿seam**: portion of code that can be treated in isolation and worked on without impacting the rest of the codebase. A good seam represents cohesive and yet loosely coupled boundaries in an organization. The first step is to identify boundaries in our code.

W﻿e want to identify seams because they can become service boundaries.

## Reasons to Split the Monolith
1. Pace of change 
2. Team structure
3. Security
4. Technology

## Tangled Dependancies
How entangled the code is with the rest of the system, you can view various seams you have found as a directed acyclical graph of dependancies. The database is a very common tangled dependancy. Transactions allow us to say these events either all happen together, or none of them happen. 

**eventual consistency**: rather than using a transactional boundary to ensure that the system is in a consistent state when the transaction completes, instead we accept that the system will get into a consistent state at some point in the future.

**distributed transaction**: try to span multiple transactions within them using an overall governing process called a transaction manager to orchestrate various transactions in the underlying systems.

**two-phase commit**: common algorithm for handling distributed transactions (especially short-lived). First is a voting phase, if gets a yes vote from all participants, then go ahead and perform the commit; a single no vote is enough to send out a rollback to all parties. This method is vulnerable to outages and locks.
