summary: Describing what is AWS Amplify
---
## What is AWS Amplify?
- a 'glue' service that helps you build entire apps quickly
- primarily used as a CLI tool, but there is a limited feature UI
- can quickly add storage, authentication, monitoring, etc.
- behind the scenes, it's just CloudFormation (Cloud Formation is an infrastructure as code solution for AWS, it allows you to write code to deploy your infrastructure out into the cloud). 

## Usage
- primarily through the CLI
- you can run `amplify configure` and `amplify add api` and follow the wizards, upon completion a lot of application code will be added to your project folder; you can make some changes to your api's directly through the editor
- when ready to deploy, the code will be packaged up and sent to the AWS cloud, where there will be n Amazon API Gateway and an AWS Lambda to host the API
- there is also another option to use the Admin UI (everything here can be done through the CLI)

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- getting started quickly
- prototyping
- fast development cycles
- shields you from complexity of AWS services
### Cons
- you don't really learn AWS services
- collaboration can be frustrating
- can't go 'outside the box' 
- potential for surprise bills (if you add things without knowing how it is billed)
