1. You make better decisions and you learn more by assuming you're dumber than everyone else
- talk less and you'll learn more
2. The hardest respect to earn is ones own
- you have to respect yourself first, and then others will follow suit
3. If you want to control what people think, control what they say
- equip people with simple language so they can understand what you do; if they understand what you do they can explain it to someone else
4. You get 5 times more out of a 1 great book than 5 mediocre books
- some books are written for the purpose of knowledge transfer whereas others are written to earn money, notoriety or selling you something
- if your behavior doesn't change as a result of reading a book, then it means you didn't learn anything, and it means it was a waste of time
5. Most champions od not have something that you do not. They lack something that you have
- they have a different thought process, we all of the same amount of hours per day, but allocate the hours differently
- they are ruthless with their time, they have singular focus and will say no to everything else
6. Goodwill compounds faster than money
- goodwill is having a positive sentiment and influence over a person's behavior
- if one person shares your stuff with someone else and they create goodwill with that person you can multiply your goodwill
- if you focus on the audience and the goodwill it will grow faster than any monetary move, you can translate that later into money whenever you want
7. You are going to die
- don't listen to people that are providing bad or negative advice
8. Extraordinary accomplishments come from doing ordinary things for extraordinary periods of time
- if you do one thing for a very very long time you will get good at it, and it will compound onto itself
- the thing that makes the action extraordinary is the commitment to it, not the nature of the action itself
9. If its worth doing, its worth doing well
- what problem are we solving?
- what am I hoping to accomplish?
- is this worth doing at all?
10. Be willing to negotiate everything except for your values
- virtually everything is negotiable
- ask the right questions
- its not zero sum you can find a point where both parties are better off
11. Humility 
- lack of pride or arrogance, increasing your regards for others
- you gain status by giving more to the group than you get
- the group rewards the person who gives to the group
12. The happy man has 1000 wishes, the sad man has 1
- when you are sad you just want to feel better
- you can think that when you have a negative encounter just think that they just wanted to feel better
13. Failure leads to learning, learning leads to success, success leads to complacency, complacency leads to failure
14. I would pay any amount of money to make obvious truths real for me 
- a lot of our assumptions are wrong, and it take time to figure that out and convince yourself
- you can learn from everyone, what do others believe to be true in the world
