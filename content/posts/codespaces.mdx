Github.dev is not Github codespaces, they're similar but they're not the same. 

Github.dev can be accessed by navigating to a repository and hitting the `.` key on the keyboard or replacing `.com` with `.dev` in the url. Commonly used to review pull requests.

What you can do in Github.dev:
- browse files
- edit files
- commit changes
- create pull requests

What you can't do in Github.dev:
- run it
- test it
- debug it

Github codespaces (container) spins up a new environment with all the dependancies (assuming the dev files are up to date). It runs on the cloud. You can run the code in codespaces, and can share that codespace with anyone (make it public, and send the url). 

Is available to Team and Enterprise Cloud plans on github.com
