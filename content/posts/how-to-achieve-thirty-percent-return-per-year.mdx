S﻿ingle most important thing is to know what you own. Should be able to explain to a child in two minutes or less why you own a stock. Stick to simple stuff that is easy to understand, if you don't understand it, then don't buy it. 

P﻿eople do research whenever they look to buy things, go on vacation; apply the same principle to buying stocks and you'll be fine.

S﻿tocks are not lottery tickets, there's a company behind every stock, if the company does well, the stock does well. People try to predict the stock market, its a waste of time, no one can predict the stock market.

L﻿ook into scrap prices for economics (eg. if you're looking at automobile stocks, look at how much used cars prices, for hotel stocks you want to know hotel occupancy), get real data points. Use economic facts, not economic predictions. 

S﻿tudy history, history is what you learn from, from history the market goes down a lot. Every two years the market falls about 10% (call that a correction), every six years the market falls more than 25% (bear market). These are good things, if you understand the company, you look at the balance sheet they're doing fine, you can get a discount. You can take advantage of the volatility of the market if you understand what you own. You have plenty of time, you don't need to get in on a company immediately there's time to watch the company to see how they do before you go in. 

Y﻿ou only need a few stocks in your lifetime, in your industry. When an industry goes from terrible to medicore the stock goes up, if goes from medicore to good the stock goes up, and when it goes from good to terrific the stock goes up.  There's lots of ways to make money in your industry, you can be a supplier, a customer. 

I﻿t's very hard to go into bankruptcy if you don't have any debt. People sell stocks because they don't know why the bought it, and then when it goes down they don't know what to do now. A lot of people think it will come back, but its not true, a lot of companies fail and never come back. 

I﻿f a company went from $100 to $3 its not necessarily a good buy; short sellers (the people that really make money in stocks) they don't short big companies (walmart, home depot, johnson and johnson). Companies that lose a lot of value are good candidates for short sellers, they are betting that the companies are going to zero.

Y﻿ou can't get too attached to stocks, understand that its a company, if it deteriorates, its a fundemental slip and you have to say good bye to it. A stock does not know you own it, Peter Lynch's best stock have been the 5-6th year that he owned it not the 5-6th day. 

U﻿nderstand that the stock market is always going to be scary, you don't need a strong brain, you need a strong stomach. Own good companies, and own turnarounds, study the companies and you'll do well.
