summary: The downsides of staying too short or too long at a company
---
Tenure within a company matters in tech, but likely in any industry as well. These notes below are generalities and not specific, everyones situation is different although these points can serve as a guideline.

## Too Short (eg. 8-12 months)
- one short tenure is acceptable given a good reason, it becomes problematic if there are many short tenures
- tells others you'll come in learn a bunch, and then leave without really adding much value to the company
- it takes time to bring value to a company usually the ramp-up is 3-6 months sometimes longer (relationship part eg. earning trust, understanding the context of what was built before)
- more senior positions can take longer to ramp up
- a typically engineer is most productive if they've been at a company for 2+ years, up until that point it's a negative ROI on that engineer
- being at a company for a year means you've been there long enough to ship something, but not long enough to see the damage you might've caused
- most learning comes from maintaining software, addressing customer issues, or requests from other teams
- should stay at least 18 months

## Too Long (eg. 8+ years)
- skills needed to operate outside the company might have atrophied 
- a caveat would be if the company is really fast growing (the company changes as it grows larger)
- if you haven't gotten promoted many times in your long tenure its a red flag
