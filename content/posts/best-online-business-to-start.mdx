Most online businesses come in the form of 
- dropshipping
- Amazon FBA
- affiliate marketing
- info products (e-books, podcasts, online-courses)

These are not beginner friendly business models, they are viable but hard to succeed. You need to evalaute the buysiness models before investing in them.

## How to evaluate a Business Model
6 important metrics
1. **Unitary gain** - how much money you make per transaction 
2. **Startup capital** - how much moeny you need to invest to get the business off the ground
3. **Profit margins** - how much you keep out of everything you make in revenue
4. **Demand** - number of people in the market looking to buy your product/service
5. **Fulfillment** - the process of delievering the product/service your customer purchased
6. **Deal type** - whether you get paid once or recurrently 

|  | Unitary Gain | Startup Capital | Margin | Demand | Fulfillment | Deal Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Affiliate Marketing | $50-$250 | $1,000-$5,000 | 10%-40% | varies | extremely easy | one-time |
| Amazon FBA | $20-$300 | $1,000-$5,000+ | 5%-50% | high | medium | one-time |
| Dropshipping | $20-$300 | $1,000-$5,000+ | 10%-60% | low | medium | one-time |
| Info products | $50-$2,000 | $1,000-$5,000+ | 20%-60% | varies | extremely hard | one-off/subscription |
| Ideal Model | $1,500+ | Close to $0 | 60%-98% | high | easy | recurrent | 

As a beginner you need to be investing the majority of your time in selling, not fulfilling the sale. The ideal business model would be a service-based business where clients pay $1,500-$10,000 per month, virtually no startup capital, 60%-98% profit margins.

Due to the pandemic a lot of businesses were forced into going online, some have not made the transition yet. Some businesses are still looking for people to help them sell online. 
Arbitrage economy, not the companies that own the final solution, but the middleman that connects the end consumer to the final product (bridge the connection for the sale to happen). This concept to be applied to other industries. 

## Selling ROI Marketing Services for Small Businesses
Our goal is to:
- sell ROI marketing services to local businesses
- get someone else to fulfill it for us
- make $1,500-$10,000/mo per client

For this business model
- you don't have to deal with inventory or shipping
- don't have to make 100+ of sales to make a decent income
- don't have to invest $10,00+ dollars to get the business running
- someone else does the fulfillment for you

## Steps
### 1. Set-up

Choose the name of your agency buy a domain and set-up an email, you don't even need a website

### 2. Pick a Niche & Service

Choosing the right niche/market is super important, think about the following:
1. is the client making at least $10,000/mo
2. do you undestand the mechanics of this niche (stick to niche, creat processes and systems, sign new clients, run new clients through proven system)

Next this is choosing the right service, it has to be an ROI service that can track a clear return on investment generated from it for the client. It is result based or revenue driven. Some examples:
- Facebook ads
- Google ads
- TikTok ads
- Email marketing
- Content creation
- Copywriting
- SEO
- Instgram growth
- Web development
- Marketing automation

### 3. Arbitrate
Can hire a contractor with experience in a per-service basis, only pay the contractor once we get paid; won't need to pay anything out of pocket. We get paid by clients at the beginning of the month, and we pay the contractors at the end of the month, so nothing should be coming out of pocket. Rough ballpark is paying the contractor $250-$1,000 per month per client, and charging the client $1,500 to $10,000 per month. 

Best places to look for contractors are the closed communities for infoproducts and software that teach what you offer as a service. 

### 4. Reach out
Reach out to potential clients, since you don't need to worry about doing the work you can focus on reaching out. Some ways to do outreaches:
- cold calling
- cold emails
- video audits
- LinkedIn outreach
- Instagram outreach

Pick the one that best suites your personality.

Remember medium to large businesses already have $30,000-$100,000 in operating costs.
