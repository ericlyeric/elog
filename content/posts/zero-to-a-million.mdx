S﻿teps to follow to make more money:
1. Realize you can do it - believe in yourself
2. Start learning online - learn current knowledge
3. Have a strong desire - be motivated to achieve your goal
4. Understand money - what do people want, how can I help get what people want
5. Choose a niche - find people with similar problems, not necessarily the value you add but the people you add that value to
6. Research your niche - don't come up with an idea, you'll be a solution in search of a problem
7. Choose an urgent problem - go and speak with people and ask them about their problems and ask them about their desires and they'll tell you what business to start
8. Sell before you build - you are providing a bridge from problem to solution
9. Solve the problem - once you've identified a problem then figure out what business model works for that problem
10. Scale

B﻿uilding a business is getting a customer is one unit case, and one unit case is getting a customer for cheaper than what the customer paid, and you repeat the process. Focus on the unit case to be as profitable as possible and then worry about the systems to scale (focus on processes after). You should solve the first unit case so well that the next person will give a referral or a testimonial to the results they had. And don't worry about getting more customers when you can confirm it can deliever results.
