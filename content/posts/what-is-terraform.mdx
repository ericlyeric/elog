Terraform is a tool developed by HashiCorp, the tool enables you to automate and manage infrastructure, platforms, and services.

With Terraform you can build and version infrastructure as code, so it will be consistent and reproducible.

Terraform uses a declarative language and is open-source.

Declarative programming (what): describes what the program does without explicitly specifying the control flow

Imperative programming (how): describes how the program should do something by explicitly specifying each instruction

Typical steps for Terraform:
- code (eg. set-up VM, container, VPC)
- plan (compare states)
- apply (apply changes)

Terraform module is a way of grouping together some Terraform automation, takes a set of input and creates an output.
