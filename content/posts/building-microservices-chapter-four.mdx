## Looking for the Ideal Integration Technology
-﻿ avoid breaking changes
-﻿ keep your API's technology-agnostic
-﻿ make your service simple for consumers
-﻿ hide internal implementation detail

#﻿# The shared Database
T﻿he most common form of integration in the industry, it has its common problems
1﻿. external parties to view and bind to internal implementation details
2﻿. consumers are tied to a specific technology choice
3﻿. sharing behavior
W﻿ith database integration we lose strong cohesion and loose coupling (both are core to a good microservice). Database integration makes it easy for services to share data, but odes nothing about sharing behavior

#﻿# Synchronous vs. Asynchronous
-﻿ **synchronous communication**: a call made to a remote server blocks until the operation completes
-﻿ **asynchronous communication**: a caller doesn't wait for the operation to complete before returning, may not even care whether the operation completes at all

B﻿oth types of modes of communication enable two different styles of collaboration
1﻿. request/response: a client initiates a request and waits for a response (synchronous model, asynchronous model)
2﻿. event-based: instead of client initiating request, it says this happened and expects other parties to know what to do (asynchronous in nature)
